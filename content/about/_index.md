---

My name is Sofie van den Brand. Currently, I am a student at the Research Master's Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences at Utrecht university. Here, I also work as a student-assistant at [ASReview](http://asreview.nl/).

Currently, I am working on my master thesis titled "The Battle of Internal Validition within Medical Prediction Models: Bootstrap vs. Cross-Validation". Its results can be found on [this git repository](https://github.com/SagevdBrand/Master-thesis) in due time.

Nice to meet you! :smile:
