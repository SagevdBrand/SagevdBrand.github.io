title: About me 
---

My name is Sofie van den Brand. Currently, I am a student at the Research Master's program Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences at Utrecht university. Here, I also work as a student-assistant at [ASReview](http://asreview.nl/).

I believe that one can always improve and learn. Therefore, I always try to develop and broaden my skills and knowledge. My specific interests lie in development and evaluation of machine learning models and programming. 

Besides methodology and statistics, I am also very passionate about working out, climbing, survival run and hiking.

Nice to meet you! :wave:
