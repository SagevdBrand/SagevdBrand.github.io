title: About me 
---

My name is Sofie van den Brand. Currently, I am a student at the Research Master's program Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences at Utrecht university. Here, I also work as a student-assistant at [ASReview](http://asreview.nl/).

I believe that one can always improve and learn. Therefore, I always try to develop and broaden my skills and knowledge. My specific interests lie in development and evaluation of machine learning models and programming. I use R as my main programming language. However, I am very willing to learn other programming languages, Python being at the top of my list. 
                            

Besides methodology and statistics, I am also very passionate about working out, climbing, survival run and hiking. My wishlist for outdoor activities consists of:

1. West Highland Way in Scotland ~ 154 km :mountain:
2. Sea kayaking in Sweden along the Bohusl√§n coast :canoe:
3. Hiking one of the great walks in New Zealand

Lastly, I also really enjoy:

* coffee :coffee:
* cooking :apple:
* playing games 
* reading :book:


Nice to meet you!
