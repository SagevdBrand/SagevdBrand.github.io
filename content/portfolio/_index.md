Currently, I am working on two projects. The first and foremost is my master thesis under supervision of Maarten van Smeden and Ben Van Calster. The second project is [ASReview](http://asreview.nl/), led by Rens van de Schoot.   

## Master thesis
Until June 2021 I will be working on my master thesis titled "The Battle of Internal Validition within Medical Prediction Models: Bootstrap vs. Cross-Validation". Here, I aim to provide applied prediction modelers with guidance on choosing a method for the internal validation of medical prediction models. By simulating different data scenarios, I investigate which type of internal validation (several bootstrap and cross- validation approaches) achieves the best estimate of out-of-sample performance within each scenario. Performance is estimated by various performance measures which look at both discrimination and calibration of the prediction models at hand. 

This is still a work in progress, its results can be found on a github repository in due time.

## ASReview
I am also involved in ASReview, a project under the leadership of Rens van de Schoot. See the separate page on ASReview below for more information.
