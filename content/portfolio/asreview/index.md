As a student-assistant within the ASReview team, I have gained experience in many areas. The most important are the following:
* Research
* Data pre-processing
* Giving workshops to new users
* Writing documentation
* Github
* Communication


During my final year of my Master's I also did my internship at ASReview. Here, I investigated possible stopping rules while screening literature for a systematic review. In a nutshell, I explored possibilities for stopping rules when screening with multiple screeners simultaneously. These stopping rules were based on Capture-recapture techniques, which aim to estimate unknown sizes of a population. In this case, the population was the number of relevant papers to be found during the screening process. The results of the exploration indicated that capture-recapture techniques may offer some basis for a stopping rule.
